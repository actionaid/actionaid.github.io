					<p>Around the world, millions of you have been shining the spotlight on dodgy tax practices of some of the world’s biggest and most profitable companies. They have been draining hundreds of billions of dollars from developing countries - funds desperately needed for vital public services that transform lives, like schools and hospitals.</p>
					<p>ActionAid supporters used people power to demand companies clean up their act, and that governments change the scandalous and outdated tax rules that let it happen – and they’ve been winning! Here are some of the highlights of the last few years. But our work is not done. We must keep fighting for tax justice.</p>

							<p>ActionAid publishes its ground-breaking report Calling Time, showing that one of the world’s largest beer companies, SABMiller which produces well-known beers including Peroni and Grolsch, dodged an estimated $30 million each year in tax revenue – enough money to educate 1/4 million children.</p>
							<p>We met Marta, from Accra in Ghana. She sells SABMiller’s Club Beer from her small stall in the shadow of the brewery where it is made. In two years Marta paid more income tax than SABMiller’s entire Ghana operation.</p><a class="ilink" href="downloads/strategy2028.pdf">

She could not afford to send her children to a decent school or get them adequate healthcare. In just three years, Caroline paid more income tax in absolute terms than Zambia Sugar.</p>
							<p>The Zambian government looked at ActionAid’s investigation into Associated British Foods and renegotiated its tax treaty with Ireland, one of the countries used by Zambia Sugar in its aggressive tax planning. The negotiation changed one of the clauses that had enabled tax avoidance. We continue to call on the Zambian government to make sure tax revenue is spent on helping children like Caroline’s to go to school.</p><a class="ilink" href="downloads/strategy2028.pdf">
