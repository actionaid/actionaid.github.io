                    <p>Yet on its eastern islands, close to the Turkish mainland, a different crisis was taking place.
                        Hundreds of thousands of desperate people, pregnant women and infants among them, were crossing to
                        the islands in fragile boats, fleeing violence and destitution in their home countries: <strong>the
                            biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two.</strong></p>
                    <p>ActionAid Hellas could not stay indifferent in such an important historical moment for the arriving
                        refugees and the country. For the first time in the history of ActionAid Hellas, the organisation
                        decided to engage directly in supporting refugees in Greece, especially women for their protection
                        and safety.</p>

                    <p>
                        By September 2015 ActionAid Hellas had started working in the Moria and Kara Tepe camps on the
                        island of Lesvos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As in all emergencies we focused our support on the most vulnerable people; pregnant women, the
                        unwell, people with special needs. Our main concern was to support women to be able to improve their
                        own situations and those of their families. And we know from experience that empowering women can
                        have the most positive impact within communities.

                    “My big sister was scared we were going to die. It was scary at the end because the boat crashed into
                    some rocks and sank. I fell into the water and I lost all my things. My mum got sick when we got off the
                    boat. She couldn’t walk properly, so a nice lady was looking after me.
                </p>
                <p>“ActionAid took my mum to a doctor. They could speak our language, so they could help tell the doctor what
                    was wrong with mummy. They gave us some warm clothes and took us to their centre where mum could sleep
                    and I could play.</p>
                <p>
                    “I always remember fighting in my country. It’s always been scary. My sister Sidra remembers what it was
                    like when there was no fighting. That’s why she gets so sad. She also misses her friends that she left

                    What relief looks like
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Believing in the fundamental importance of people’s dignity as human beings in this most distressing of
                    situations, we consulted people about their needs, rather than assuming what these were on their behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “When women get through the door of our centre and hear me speak Arabic, they calm down. I tell them I’m
                    from Syria and I can see their joy. Then, little by little, we start to talk about their journey at sea,
                    the life they left behind, what happened to their city. They want to talk about their life in Syria.
                    Sometimes I see they find it hard to leave the Centre, although they are in a hurry to get registered.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    They told us that their priorities were <strong>reliable information in their own language</strong>, so
                    we rapidly recruited Arabic and Farsi speakers resident in Greece; <strong>psychological and social
                    support</strong> to help deal with the traumas they had suffered and to provide confidence to move
                    forward; <strong>essential winter items</strong> such as blankets, hats and gloves to survive the harsh
                    conditions of a European winter; <strong>skills and activities: </strong>Greek and English classes, arts
                    and crafts – both practical skills, creative activities and physical fitness to provide people with some
                    relief in the camps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As well as this, we made sure to raise our voice on their behalf to highlight their needs, lobby for
                    solutions and raise funds for our work.
                </p>
                <p>Much of our activity was centred on Day Centres safe places dedicated to women and their babies inside
                    the camps.</p>

                    In March 2016 the situation changed. Borders on the route to other European countries had closed,
                    effectively trapping more than 60,000 people in Greece staying in camps, detention centres and abandoned
                    buildings all over the country. And then the EU, desperate to stem the flow of people seeking safety in
                    Europe, struck an unjust and inhumane deal with Turkey to prevent the boats leaving and to return
                    asylum-seekers whose applications had failed, trading away the human rights of people fleeing war and
                    persecution.

                <p>Amina’s husband, who was in a wheelchair, died when their boat sank. He is now buried on Lesvos. She was
                    rescued the day before the EU-Turkey deal but needed to prove it in order to qualify for the relocation
                    programme.</p>
                <p>
                    “I arrived at Lesvos on 19 March, one day before the EU–Turkey agreement. Psychologically I wasn’t
                    feeling good… They helped me to prove that my exact day of arrival was one day before the agreement...
                    Whenever I was with ActionAid’s staff I was feeling calm. They were like family to me… If ActionAid
                    wasn’t there for me at the very beginning I wouldn’t be able to prove my arrival day and apply for the
                    relocation program.”

                    Alongside other agencies ActionAid suspended work in Moria camp in March 2016, in protest against the
                    inhumane conditions when the reception facility was turned into a detention centre. We later returned to
                    offer humanitarian assistance after a devastating fire in the camp caused by overcrowding in September
                    2016.
                </p>
                <p>After the borders closed our work changed: it was not about meeting the needs of a transient, displaced
                    population, but those of a vulnerable people who would remain in Greece for an indefinite time.</p>
                <p>
                    In May 2016 we extended our work to the region around Athens, at the camps of Schisto and Skaramagas.
                    Reluctantly, due to insufficient funding, we later had to withdraw from Lesvos where arrival numbers
                    were falling; handing our work in Kara Tepe camp, which still continues, to Caritas.

                    In March 2017, a group of women refugees took the lead in the production and writing of a play called
                    “Voices without Voice”. The women acted alongside men refugees, performing their play to an audience of
                    residents from other camps, ActionAid staff, the NGO community and local people. The refugee actors and
                    their supporters were Afghanis and Iranians from Schisto camp.

                    confidence to interact with the societies they have found themselves in have been a crucial
                    contribution. In the stressful conditions of the camps, couples’ counselling and opportunities for

            <p>Unfortunately funding was not available to maintain our current Attica camp operations. The Greek government has also signaled a national shift of closing refugee camps and integrating refugees within an urban setting. As the situation continues to change, ActionAid will strive to meet needs of these refugees by helping with health and wellbeing, legal support, education and urban resilience. </p>
